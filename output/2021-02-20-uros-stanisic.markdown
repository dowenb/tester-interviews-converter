## Interview

### Where are you in your testing journey?

Currently, went to management role. For 2 years now I'm not working hands on in testing

### The best bug you have ever found?

It was not a bug in the software, but I call it probably the best personal achievement. My colleague and I were working on a software that needed to implement many different international standards in that area. While reading standards we have found a bug there :) So, our work ended up with the update of 3 international standards.

### Advice you would give to Testers?

Be bold, be curious, speak up, be persistent. And learn when to stop.

### What does winning mean to you?

I always look at it as a team effort. Even if you have a contest where you have a  single winner, there is always someone behind that person. So, at the end it is always a team win. And I like to see people satisfied once they are a part of a winning team.
