## Interview

### Where are you in your testing journey?

Testing hero in my organization. Responsible for building architecture for writing tests and also coaching my colleagues how to write better tests.

### The best bug you have ever found?

We had a very nasty bug in our retry logic when calling 3rd party API endpoints. Bug manifested in very weird exceptions that would occur on random places and only sometimes (fun times when working with multi-threading and smart throttling mechanisms).

We where able to figure out the issue after extensive debugging and usage of different tools (Fiddler ftw), and it was a great feeling when we finally fixed the issue after a week long troubleshooting session. This also confirmed the value of automated tests, which could have caught this behavior :)

### Advice you would give to Testers?

Every beginning is very hard. When I first started writing automated tests I had a feeling that setups where overly complicated, that my tests where more complicated than the code they where supposed to be checking and that they didn't have any value.

But over time you learn how to develop architecture that helps with setups, learn what should be tested. Just keep learning and if you have someone more experienced in your organization ask for advice :)

### What does winning mean to you?

It is a great motivation for writing more posts. I have just started my blogging journey so this validation means a lot.
