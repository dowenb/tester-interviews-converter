## Interview

### Where are you in your testing journey?

Now I'm an engineering manager at a company with a vibrant open source community. Our open source contributors are mostly developers (and there are thousands of them!) and I'm looking to find ways to make it easy for testers who want to contribute to an open source project to do so!

### The best bug you have ever found?

The best was my first - in my first 4 hours of testing on my first testing job ever, I found 76 bugs and broke the application critically, resulting in 3 days of fixing needed. It's what got me hooked.

### Advice you would give to Testers?

Learn about the ecosystem you work in. Yes, the bulk of the work ends up being in testing, but knowing the stack, the underlying technologies, and the business decisions that are happening around you helps you to focus your testing on what's important to everyone, even if it isn't explicitly stated.

### What does winning mean to you?

Getting up every day and helping people do what they love to do.
