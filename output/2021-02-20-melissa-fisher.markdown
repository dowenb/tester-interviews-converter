## Interview

### Where are you in your testing journey?

I've been getting more involved in the testing community over the last year, which has been so valuable.  I'm always looking to learn and improve my testing, coaching, mentoring and line manager skills.

### The best bug you have ever found?

Oh so many, one was bringing down the production environment by doing some performance tests in our test environment (there was a database link connection between the two environments that I wasn't aware of).

### Advice you would give to Testers?

Stay curious - ask questions!

### What does winning mean to you?

A sign that I have incredible supportive people around me that believe I add value.
